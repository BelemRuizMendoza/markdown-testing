<br>This is still an h2, no matter it's the first one to be turned into a header using \---
---  
And use **alt + 92 for the backslash** (\\), which escapes characters.
<br><br><br>

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
![][image3]
#### Header 4  
This is bodytext size.
##### Header 5
###### Herader 6

Another way to insert a pagebreak is by typing [space] + [space] + [intro]:  
  
Here, in the middle of something else, looks like a good place for my second referenced link:  
Wanna read about the [Mexican 2.0]? Well, click the previous link.    

Or by using a backslash at the end of a line?
<br><br><br>
  
***  
```html
!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
<p>Hello World Example</p>
<script>
 alert("Hello, " + "Belem! \nSecond line?");
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Turning text into h2 within the bodytext:  
---  
And calling my first link by doing the following:  
This is my reference-style link: [blockchain].  
The id becomes the anchor text and contains the URL. ♥
<br><br><br>
***
Now, let's create a bulleted list:
---
* Item 1.
* Item 2.
* Item 3.
* ...
<br><br><br>

Then, an ordered list:
---
1. First.
2. Second.
3. Third.
4. ...
<br><br><br>
***
## Nested quotations:
> Entonces, ella dijo:
>> «Me recuerda a la línea final de un haikú:»
>>> "... one-sided love."  

<br><br><br>
![Nothing you write here when you make the call will matter/be displayed.][imagen1]
## Tables, tables, tables!
|column 1| column 2 | column 3|
|:----|:-----:|-----:|
|This is random text for column 1, row 1.|This is random text for column 2, row 1.|This is random text for column 3, row 1.|
|This is random text for column 1, row 2.|This is random text for column 2, row 2.|This is random text for column 3, row 2.|
|This is random text for column 1, row 3.|This is random text for column 2, row 3.|This is random text for column 3, row 3.|
<br><br><br>
***
For my next trick... `<br><br><br>`. **Alt + 96 for the accent character.** Escaped text that is supposed to be in Courier New...

<br><br><br>

There is this other cool way of doing it, by creating a list where each image has an ID you can use to call the image you want when and where you want it.
<br><br><br>

### As references (the URLs are in the following lines but are not displayed in the document)
