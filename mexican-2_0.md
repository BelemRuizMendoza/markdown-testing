# Diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and the “Mexican 2.0”
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [notes] that Mexico has been acclaimed for its “ambitious and comprehensive approach addressing diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases through public health and public policy programs”, but that “secondary prevention [early detection and adequate treatment] is not well provided”.  
  
What if instead of trying to change habits and environments we focus on the development of personalized treatments and low-cost technologies that strengthen human organs, allow early diagnoses and enhance innate capacities? A little bit futuristic? Well, in fact, Mexico could have new medical technologies against Parkinson’s disease and diabetes in less than five years.  

## The Mexican reality
Mexico is the country where workers spend the [most hours] in their respective places of employment. It is estimated that the [daily expense] to cover the essential market basket is $312.70 (£10.97).  
  
In 2017, of the 52.19 million [Mexicans with a job]:
* 47.9% earned $160 (£5.61) or less per day,
* 21% earned $240 (£8.42),
* 12.55% earned between $240 (£8.42) and $400 (£14.03),
* only 5.3% earned $400 (£14.03) or more.  
  
This is why it is so difficult to follow a balanced diet with fixed schedules, and other types of healthy habits.  

On the other hand, regardless of how unrepresentative or outdated the studies in this matters are, the truth is that diabetes mellitus is becoming a [pandemic] associated with overweight and obesity that in just one decade claimed the lives of more than [800,000] Mexicans.  

Parkinson’s disease, which is already suffered by about [1%] of the world’s population, is expected to continue to affect more and more people, as life expectancy increases (the same applies to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s).  
  
In 2016, the Mexican diabetic population was more than [15%], this is, about 18.45 millions of Mexicans were diabetics; and in 2013 there were more than [500,000] Mexicans with Parkinson’s disease.  
  
## Science, technology, and innovation at the service of clinical medicine
Thanks to the advances and discoveries of the last decades, the opportunities for improvement detected during the practice of clinical medicine have influenced or generated various lines of research, and are now helpful while proposing solutions based on precision, regenerative or translational approaches (or a combination of these).  
  
In different media it is possible to read about the “humans 2.0”, those who improve their abilities and skills through the use of the internet of things, wearables, bioprinting, exoskeletons, robotic prostheses, genetic editing included, as well as some quirks (which are unpopular with the scientific community).  
  
But, in science, “[human 2.0]” is referred to when talking about various available genetic technologies, such as the use of chimeric antigen receptors against cancer, adeno-associated viruses that allow patients with visual impairment to regain their sight, to name but a few; some other promising innovations are also mentioned, like mitochondrial replacement therapy, germline engineering, and gene editing technologies.  
  
## Medical and pharmaceutical biotechnology developed by the Ciatej for the “Mexican 2.0”
Emmanuel Díaz, Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Sciences, leads a multidisciplinary scientific group at the Center for Research and Assistance in Technology and Design of Jalisco State ([Ciatej], Centro de Investigación y Asistencia en Tecnología y Diseño del Estado de Jalisco); his team also has consultancies and collaborations from various national and international scientific-academic entities.  
  
These scientists dedicate their research and experiments to the development of new methodologies and tools for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of diabetes mellitus and Parkinson’s disease. The main tasks carried out by this group within the Ciatej’s Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology unit are focused on:  
1. reprograming, and experimenting on stem cells;
2. editing genes via CRISPR/Cas9 technology;
3. creating a low-cost genetic screening method;
4. developing wearable and mobile applications.
  
Three years after its adoption in the Ciatej, these lines of research have produced a patent for a non-invasive method to obtain stem cells that reduces between 70 and 80 percent the costs of this process.  

“For us, it is very important, because the goal is to benefit the general population, so that everyone can have the opportunity to receive personalized treatment or an early diagnosis. And, even more, to receive it in a not-so-expensive way”, commented PhD Díaz.  

## Helping to improve Mexican’s quality and life expectancy
Emmanuel stated that low-cost genetic screening is one of their main goals for 2018. Today, he assures, its cost ranges from $12,000 to $15,000 Mexican pesos (from £420.99 to £526.24).  

> “It is known that there are genes that may be involved in memory, in cognitive development; several things that we can classify as faster learning, for example. What would be better than giving this tool to the entire population through a screening tool that does not cost more than a thousand Mexican pesos [£35.08]?”  
  
The experimentation with stem cells carried out in Ciatej is aimed at:
* testing how different drugs (and combinations of these) work in a particular organism;
* detecting biomarkers for early disease detection;
* generating tissue substitutes or replacing damaged organs (due to a chronic degenerative process or trauma).  
  
Díaz highlights the fact that they intend to give the Mexican population tools so that their organisms are capable of “resisting these metabolic challenges, or this stress in which we are living”, because “we are already in a super polluted environment, [with] toxic substances, toxins, sewage… Why not strengthen the inner part [of our bodies]?”.
  
If the environment and current living conditions are adverse, “it is best to start from the inside, to improve both quality and life expectancy”. The researcher estimates that the first of these deliverables for the “Mexican 2.0” will be ready to be transferred to the Mexican health sector between 2020 and 2022.
